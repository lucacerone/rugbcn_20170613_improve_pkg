# Introduction

## Who am I? (1/2)

* Data manager/statistician for CHAI project at ISGlobal.

* PhD in statistics.

* R user, developper, addict.

* R-Ladies BCN co-organizer.

* Co-editor at rOpenSci onboarding (more on that later!)

## Who am I? (2/2): Mowgli's sister!

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = "400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/mowgli.jpg")
```

## What does improving the package mean?

* Coding style (against errors, and for future readers&contributors)

* Tests (such good safeguards!)

* Structure (follow the rules)

* Documentation (think of the users, including you in 3 months!)

## Automatic tools?

* Automatic suggestions of improvements

* Not automatic corrections... Animo!

## Today's talk

For each tool,

* Introduction

* Application to `fakepackage`.

Questions any time chic@s!

# Conclusion

## Tools we've seen

* R CMD check

* `lintr`

* `devtools::spell_check()`

* `goodpractice::gp()`

* `pkgdown::build_site()`

## Tools we haven't seen

* Continuous integration, cf [this post of Julia Silge's](http://juliasilge.com/blog/Beginners-Guide-to-Travis/)

* Online code coverage services such as codecov.io

* Any other suggestion?

## Have your code&docs read by humans

* Peer-review at work or among friends

* [The R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/), [Journal of Open Science Software](http://joss.theoj.org/about)

* [rOpenSci onboarding system!](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding) Who wants to become a reviewer?
